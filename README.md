In early-mid 2022 APT42 started broadcasting MrRobot, a Hacking TV show created by Sam Esmail.  
At the end of each show, a presentation was made to tickle students intrest in hacking, here are some ressources about those presentations. 

## Session 1: Implants, proximity hack

[shellter](https://www.shellterproject.com/) / dynamic shellcode injection tool for PE32 binaries  
[metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) / hacking framework used to receive a meterpreter (a shell on steroid)  
[rubber ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) / keyboard / mouse emulator, expensive  
[leonardo](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardLeonardo) / keyboard / mouse emulator, cheap, buy it on banggood / aliexpress (you can get a uno and flash the firmware but i don't recommend it)  
[OMG cable](https://o.mg.lol/) / cable that looks normal but hides a computer inside that can sniff data that transit in the cable  
[usb killer](https://usbkill.com/) / i don't know if it's the official site, don't buy it anyway  
[hackrf](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) / according to Shenron it's probably the best way to spend 250$ (and i trust him)  
[bladerf](https://www.nuand.com/bladerf-2-0-micro/) / same as above, more accurate and better for some frequences.  
[rtl sdr](https://www.passion-radio.fr/cles-rtl-sdr/87) / same as above, just less powerful and worse accuracy but very cheap and great for it's price, you can buy it on aliexpress for roughly 20/30$  
[gnu radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) software useful to manage the 3 tool mentionned above  
[flipper zero](https://flipperzero.one/) / hacking tamagotchi, look for videos on twitter of people using it, very funny but quite expensive (was ~100$ in the kickstarter, now 170$ and out of stock)
